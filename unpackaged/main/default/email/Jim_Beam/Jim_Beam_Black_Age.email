<p>Thanks for your interest in Jim Beam Black®. We recently refreshed the bottle and label to better reflect the premium liquid inside the glass. The liquid in the new packaging is the exact same extra aged liquid in the former packaging. Jim Beam Black will always be a Kentucky Straight Bourbon that's extra-aged to taste, and we will continue to ensure that the liquid in the bottle (what matters most) always delivers on the qualities and attributes that are expected from Jim Beam® Black, such as its richer aroma, darker color and smoother, more complex flavor profile.</p>
