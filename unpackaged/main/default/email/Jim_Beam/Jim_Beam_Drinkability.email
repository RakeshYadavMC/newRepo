<p>Thanks for your note, and for your interest in Jim Beam® products! Unopened bottles from that period are definitely a rare find indeed - usually folks are too eager to consume the great liquid inside! And while we can't advise you on whether or not it's recommended that you consume alcohol, we can definitely comment on the quality of the product inside the bottle.</p>
<p>A couple things to keep in mind before you open it. First, generally speaking the liquid will taste just like it did the day it was bottled for about 10-15 years after bottling if kept outside of direct sunlight and at room temperature. After that time, the seal may allow impurities in that will change the taste.</p>
<p>My recommendation if you intend to open a bottle is to always pour the liquid into a clear glass and look at the color, smell the aroma and give it a small taste. If all of those tests pass, then you're free to drink your old bottle of whiskey in moderation! Otherwise, best to trust your gut if something just seems off. I hope that helps!</p>
