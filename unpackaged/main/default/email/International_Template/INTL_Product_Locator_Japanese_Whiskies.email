<p><u>Japanese Whiskies in Japan</u><br>
Thank you for your interest in and support for Suntory Whisky.&nbsp;<br>
Unfortunately, due to high demand and limited stock, we are unable to respond to inquiries regarding in-store purchases of our premium whiskies.&nbsp;<br>
To confirm stock availability and pricing, we recommend contacting retailersâ€”such as department stores and liquor shopsâ€”directly. We cannot recommend stores because the stock at each store is so limited, a lot of times when we recommend a specific store we have contracts with, the customer will visit only to find that the product is sold out.<br>
Thank you for your understanding.<br>
