<p>Thank you for your query related to (xxx). We are not in a position to verify the content of bottles bought outside the sales channels that we have control over. To accurately verify this product the bottle would need to be opened and the liquid tested, there may also be a requirement to conduct testing on the closures and labels that would damage them. I hope you can understand that this would not be feasible.</p>
<p>We can however match the LOT code (traceability code) with the production records for that day. &nbsp;If you can see attached example of the LOT code and advise us of this number starting with L followed by a series of numbers and letters.</p>
Best Regards
