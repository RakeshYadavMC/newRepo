<p>Scotch Whisky is produced from the fermentation and distillation of malted barley. &nbsp;Gluten can be found in small grains such as rye, barley, oats, wheat, etc. &nbsp;It is generally accepted that the process of distillation excludes gluten in the finished product. All other ingredients in the product do not contain gluten.</p>
