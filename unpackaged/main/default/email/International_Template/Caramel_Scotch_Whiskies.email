<p>We do use caramel to colour some of our products particularly the core range which have to remain consistent from a brand perspective, please read the following:<br>
The adding of caramel is for consistency, whiskies are made from natural products and matured over many seasons in Oak casks. &nbsp;There is always some variation in the process from the wood of the casks, to the time of year the casks were filled, to where in the Warehouse the cask was Matured. &nbsp;We endeavour to minimise the overall difference from batch to batch by checking and selecting casks from different distillation dates and from different parts of the warehouse and carefully blending them together. &nbsp;There will still be subtle differences, which creates the need to add caramel to match consumers standards.</p>
<p>The adding of caramel to the liquid shouldnâ€™t hinder you when visually attending information from it, nor will it determine the quality of the liquid. &nbsp;A minimal amount of caramel is used in our brands and will only subtly accentuate the colour already present and to conform it to the standards of whisky and of the brand.</p>

<p>If you have a particular variant you would like to know more about, please advise.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
