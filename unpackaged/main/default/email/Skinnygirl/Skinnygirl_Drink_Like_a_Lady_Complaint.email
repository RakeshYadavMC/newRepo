<p>This campaign was designed to spark conversations –of all kinds –about our brand. Our intention is to offer our audiences an entertaining and tongue-in-cheek advertisement that is bold and playful, yet sophisticated.  </p>
<p>Skinnygirl® Cocktails is known for its line of low-calorie cocktail options, as well as its fun, light-hearted and playful tone. We strive to make the cocktail experience for today's women as effortless, enjoyable and guilt-free as possible.</p>

We appreciate your feedback, as it allows us the opportunity to learn from our consumers and help our brand evolve and grow.</p>
