<p>Thanks for being a great fan and inquiring about Pinnacle Vodka. We have unfortunately discontinued our {!Case.Product_Type__c} and do not have plans to bring the flavor back at this time. There may be a limited quantity of bottles remaining on shelves, but once they're gone, they will not be replaced. We'd recommend calling your local retailer to inquire about the current availability of any remaining bottles. We also encourage you to stay tuned for new recipes featuring our other great flavors. Thanks for being a great fan and supporting Pinnacle Vodka. </p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
