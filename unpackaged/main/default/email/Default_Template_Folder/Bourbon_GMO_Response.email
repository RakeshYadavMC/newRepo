<p>We're devoted to bringing you the highest quality bourbon, and making history in the spirits industry with thoughtfully crafted products. We are also committed to reducing the presence of GM ingredients in our supply chain. Given that, in 2016, we started asking our farmers to use and plant non-GM ingredients in our supply. While we make this effort, final planting decisions are up to the farmers and we can't guarantee that our product is non-<span class="caps">GMO</span>. We do also feel confident that because the distillation process removes genetic materials from our distillate, all our finished distilled spirits products -- whether they are produced with GM or non-GM ingredients -- do not contain residual <span class="caps">GMO</span> materials and our consumers can enjoy these products with confidence.</p>
<p>As bourbon lovers, we are committed to creating products that all of our consumers can enjoy with confidence. The measures we're taking to reduce GM materials from our bourbon solidifies that commitment. We will continue to stay true to our heritage, keeping our stories process intact, by asking our current farmers to plant non-<span class="caps">GMO</span> seed. Our bourbon will continue to be the delicious bourbon we all love, and we hope you continue to enjoy it responsibly!</p>
