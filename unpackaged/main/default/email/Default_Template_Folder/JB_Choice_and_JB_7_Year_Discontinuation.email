<p>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}</p>

<p>Thank you for asking about Jim Beam Choice and Jim Beam 7 year. While they were a favorite, we've made the decision to stop making both of these so that we can make new whiskey. Have you tried Jim Beam Single Barrel, or Jim Beam Black? They are both great options to try to hopefully fill your quest for Jim Beam Choice and Jim Beam 7.</p>
