<p>Thanks for reaching out and for being a fan of {!Case.Brand__c} We love hearing from fans like you. We're proud to offer custom bottle engravings at our distillery in Clermont, KY. However, due to legal concerns, these need to be purchased in person and we're unable to mail them directly to you. Therefore, if you are looking for the perfect custom gift but are unable to travel to see us in Kentucky, we'd suggest you purchase a bottle of {!Case.Brand__c} at one of your nearby retailers and see if you can find a 3rd party engraver who can do the customization piece for you. </p>
