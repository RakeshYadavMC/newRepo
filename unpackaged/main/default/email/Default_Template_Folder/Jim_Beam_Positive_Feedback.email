<p>Thank you for reaching out, we love reading emails like these! We wouldn't be the world's #1 bourbon without the world's #1 fans. Ever since we started making bourbon back in 1795, it's still our fans that keep us motivated to keep on doing what we do. We are proud to be the bourbon in your glass. Hope you continue to enjoy Jim Beam for many years to come. Cheers!</p>
