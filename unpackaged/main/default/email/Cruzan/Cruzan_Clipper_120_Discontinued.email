<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Cruzan Rum. We always like to hear from our consumers.</p>
<p>We are glad to hear you enjoyed this fine product. Unfortunately the past few years Cruzan Rum has been focusing on our core business, our light, dark &amp; flavored rums and in turn, Cruzan Clipper wound up being discontinued.  The good news is that Cruzan 151 Rum has an almost identical taste profile and you should be able to find this product at your local liquor spirits retailer.  If they don't have this product in stock, you can ask that they place a special order on your behalf to bring this product into their store for you to purchase.  They should be able to accommodate this request.  We simply suggest you initially inquire about any special order minimums they may have in place so you are not surprised at any point once the process has been initiated.</p>
<p>We hope this information will be helpful for you and we certainly hope you continue to enjoy Cruzan Rums and all our fine products for many more years to come.</p>
