<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Cruzan Rum.  We always love to hear from our consumers and fans of the Brand like you!</p>
<p>We did recently have a proof change to our flavored rums.  Our rums are considered “mixables” meaning they are more often than not, mixed with other alcohol/spirits to make a specific cocktail.  We were receiving feedback that these finished drinks were “too strong” and had “too much alcohol” so in order to better serve the preferences of our consumers we have lowered the content of the alcohol in our flavored rums so your finished cocktails will taste just right.   </p>
<p>Of course, you can still drink our flavored rums on the rocks.  They do not need to be mixed with other spirits in order to taste good/better.  Whether mixed into a cocktail or on its own, you will still be consuming the best rums around when you consume Cruzan Rums!</p>
