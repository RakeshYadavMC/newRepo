<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p>According to Star-K Kosher Certification Organization (http://www.star-k.org), Scotch Whiskey is a kosher approved alcoholic beverage, except when the label states "aged in sherry casks", "sherry finish", "port finish", "madeira finish", "dual cask finish", "double matured". According to Kosher Quest Search (http://kosherquest.org), no Hashgacha required (except when label states aged exclusively in sherry casks, or has sherry finish, port finish or dual cask finish).</p>
<p>Beam Suntory rums are not certified through any Kosher Certification Organizations.</p>
