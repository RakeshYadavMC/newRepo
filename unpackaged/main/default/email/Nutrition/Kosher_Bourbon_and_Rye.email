<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p>According to Star-K Kosher Certification Organization (http://www.star-k.org), bourbon/rye whiskey is a kosher approved alcoholic beverage. According to Kosher Quest Search (http://kosherquest.org), no Hashgacha required.</p>
<p>Beam Suntory bourbons/ryes are not certified through any Kosher Certification Organizations.</p>
