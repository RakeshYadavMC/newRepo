<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p>According to Star-K Kosher Certification Organization (http://www.star-k.org), flavored vodkas are considered kosher approved alcoholic beverages. According to Kosher Quest Search (http://kosherquest.org), no Hashgacha required.</p>
<p>Beam Suntory vodkas are not certified through any Kosher Certification Organizations.</p>
