<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p>The primary alcohol source and other ingredients in {!Case.Product_Type__c} do not contain gluten. A secondary alcohol source is produced from the fermentation and distillation of wheat. Gluten can be found in small grains such as rye, barley, oats, wheat, ect. It is generally accepted that the process of distillation excludes gluten in the finished product.</p>
