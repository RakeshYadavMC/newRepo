<p>Thank you for your email and for contacting {!Case.Brand__c}®.  We appreciate your interest and support of {!Case.Brand__c} And while partnering with you sounds like a spirited way to promote {!Case.Brand__c}®, we have a strict social responsibility code within our organization. As part of that, we are unable to conduct sponsorships or promotions near college campuses because we do not condone consumption of our products by those who are under the legal purchasing age.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding and thanks again for the compliment of your invitation to participate.  We wish you and your team the best of luck.</p>
