<p>Thank you for your email.  While many factors determine price, we do not control the price of our premium spirits once they have left our organization. Distributors and retailers are free to price brands according to what the marketplace will command if they choose to.</p>
<p>At the same time, we stand by our commitment to quality and proudly purchase premium grains to meet the high standards we require for our spirits. We also continue to invest in the craftsmanship and time-honored processes that have become hallmarks of our quality brands. Variance in the cost of these goods and services may result in higher costs to us leading us to raise prices from time to time. We believe that charging a bit more than we did a year or two ago is preferable to cutting corners to reduce costs and risking the quality for which we are known.</p>
<p>As a consumer that appreciates premium spirits, we hope you respect this philosophy and you will continue to enjoy our brands for many years to come!</p>
<p>Either way, thanks for contacting us. We respect your opinion and are pleased you have taken the time to share it.</p>
