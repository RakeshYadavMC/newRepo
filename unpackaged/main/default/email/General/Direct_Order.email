<p>Thank you for your email and interest in {!Case.Brand__c}.  We always love hearing from our consumers and fans of the Brand like you!</p>
<p>We suggest that you check with your local spirits retailer in order to find, order and purchase {!Case.Brand__c}.  Unfortunately, the shipping and receipt of spirits in the United States is strictly regulated, and we are unable to accept online orders or ship our products directly to our consumers.</p>
<p>You should be able to find a variety of {!Case.Brand__c} products from your local spirits retailer.  If they do not have what you are looking for we suggest you ask your local retailer or state store to place an order with their distributor on your behalf to bring product into their store for you to purchase.  They should have no problems accommodating this type of request.  We simply suggest you initially inquire about any special order minimums they may have in place so you are not surprised at any point once the process has been initiated.</p>
<p>We hope this information will be helpful for you and we certainly hope you continue to enjoy {!Case.Brand__c} and all our fine products for many more years to come.</p>
