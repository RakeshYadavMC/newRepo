Here at HornitosÂ® Tequila, we take the quality of our products very seriously and have a robust set of quality assurance processes in place to make certain our products meet only the highest standards. We have identified the issue with the cork closure on a limited number of Hornitos bottles and have implemented corrective measures to ensure that this does not happen again. <br />
We would like to offer either a replacement cork closure for your bottle or a one-time a reimbursement for your purchase. Please let us know which option you would prefer, and please provide your mailing address along with a copy of your receipt or a note detailing your purchase price. Once we receive this information please allow 2-3 weeks for processing.<br />
We certainly value you as a key customer and sincerely hope that you will continue to enjoy all our products responsibly.</p>
