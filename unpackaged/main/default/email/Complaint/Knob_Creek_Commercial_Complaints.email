<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p>Booker Noe, the creator of Knob Creek® Bourbon and father of small batch bourbon, was never one to turn down an opportunity to discuss his greatest passion. And like Booker, we are always eager to talk about bourbon with our fans. So when said in our TV advertisements to bring your bourbon back if you don't like it, we certainly meant it!</p>
<p>We would like to cordially invite you to come visit us in Clermont, Kentucky to learn how Knob Creek is crafted –from fermentation and distillation, to patiently aging in the rackhouse –and to find the bourbon that best suits your preferences.</p>
<p>Please let us know when you plan to visit Kentucky, and we will gladly schedule time for a tour.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Your Friends at Knob Creek® Bourbon</p>
