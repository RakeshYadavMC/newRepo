<p>Thank you for taking the time to contact us about your concern with {!Case.Template_Product_Name__c}. We appreciate you bringing your concern to our attention. It is a requirement for us to print a lot code on each bottle which matches it to a specific batch. Without the bottle or lot code we are unable to perform any additional analysis to research this complaint.</p>

<p>As manufacturers and marketers of quality products, we never want our consumers to have a bad experience with one of our brands. If you purchase another Beam Suntory product of similar value and reply with a copy of your receipt, I&#39;m happy to provide a reimbursement.</p>

<p>If you should happen to experience this again, please keep the bottle and its contents and contact us immediately.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
