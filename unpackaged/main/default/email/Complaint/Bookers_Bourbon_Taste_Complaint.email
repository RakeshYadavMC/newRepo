<p>Thank you for your feedback.  We're sorry that Booker's did not live up to your expectations.  We want to provide you with some more details about Booker's Bourbon.  It is uncut and bottled straight from the barrel.  Because of this each batch will have a slightly different proof and different taste characteristics.  The typical proof range is 121° - 131°.  Hope this helps explain the variation, but if you feel there is an off taste, please let us know and we will proceed accordingly.</p>
