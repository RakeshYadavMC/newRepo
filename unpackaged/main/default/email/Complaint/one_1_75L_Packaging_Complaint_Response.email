<p>We are aware of an issue relating to the pourer of our 1.75L package coming out of the bottle with the cap instead of remaining seated in the mouth of the bottle as it was designed.  We have recently completed the analysis of this problem and have taken steps to correct the issue.  We apologize for any inconvenience you have encountered and appreciate your feedback in helping to identify the defect and resolve this matter.</p>
